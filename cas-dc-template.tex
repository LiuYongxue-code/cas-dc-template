\begin{abstract}
\emph{Background and aim:} lnadequately designed equipment has been implicated in poor efficiency and criticalincidents associated with resuscitation. A novel resuscitation trolley (Resus:Station) was designed ancevaluated for impact on team efficiency, user opinion, and teamwork, compared with the standard trolleyin simulated cardiac arrest scenarios.

\emph{Methods:} Fifteen experienced cardiac arrest teams were recruited (45 participants). Teams performedrecorded resuscitation simulations using new and conventional trolleys, with order of use randomised.

After each simulation, efficiency (â€œtime to drugs", un-locatable equipment, unnecessary drawer open-ing) and team perforance (OSCAR) were assessed from the video recordings and participants wereasked to complete questionnaires scoring various aspects of the trolley on a Likert scale.Results: Time to locate the drugs was significantly faster (p =0001) when using the Resus:Station (mean5.19 s(SD 3.34)) than when using the standard trolley (26.81 s (SD16.05)).

There were no reports of missing equipment when using the Resus:Station. However, during four ofthe fifteen study sessions using the standard trolley participants were unable to find equipment, with anaverage of 6.75 unnecessary drawer openings per simulation.

User feedback results clearly indicated a highly significant preference for the newly designedResus:Station for all aspects.

Teams performed equally well for all dimensions of team performance using both trolleys, despite itbeing their first exposure to the Resus:Station.Conclusion: We conclude that in this simulated environment, the new design of trolley is safe to use, andhas the potential to improve efficiency at a resuscitation attempt.

We would ideally repeat this at a real arrest witha full resuscitation team. However, this small study has enabled usto have some insight into the potential impact of an ergonomicallydesigned resuscitation trolley.}
